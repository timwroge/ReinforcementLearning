use the initial function provided by matlab
You can modify it as much or as little as you want

	DoPostPropSetup(block)
		define the work areas and state variables (the memory of the code)
		to initialize states:
	InitializeConditions(block)
		declare initial condition
	Outputs(block)
		this will give ports and output of the block
	SetInpPortFrameData(block, idx, fd)
		change this to control for mulitple inputs
	Terminate(block)
		This will run when the simulation is over
